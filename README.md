# Python Research Project: Simple Interactive Applications

## Overview

This Python research project explores the development of simple interactive applications using various Python libraries and frameworks. The project focuses on creating user-friendly interfaces, incorporating audio elements, and building interactive features to enhance user engagement.

## Projects

### 1. GUI Calculator

- **Description**: A simple graphical calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: tkinter, PyQT, or Kivy.
- **Features**: GUI interface with buttons for digits and operators, display screen for input/output, and support for basic arithmetic operations.

### 2. Audio Player

- **Description**: An audio player application that allows users to play, pause, stop, and skip audio tracks.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: pygame, tkinter (for GUI), and mutagen (for audio file metadata).
- **Features**: GUI interface with buttons for playback controls, support for various audio formats (e.g., mp3, wav), and display of audio file metadata.

### 3. Weather App

- **Description**: An interactive weather application that provides current weather information based on user input (e.g., location).
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: tkinter (for GUI), requests (for API requests), and OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Features**: Input field for location selection, display of current weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), and option to refresh data.

### 4. Interactive Quiz Game

- **Description**: An interactive quiz game that presents questions to the user and evaluates their answers.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: tkinter (for GUI), random (for question selection), and pandas (for data management).
- **Features**: GUI interface with multiple-choice questions, timer for each question, score tracking, and feedback on correct/incorrect answers.
